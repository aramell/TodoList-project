This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Basic Todo application using React, Typescript, and Jest/React-Testing-Library for testing

## Features of Todo List:

    The ability to add a to-do item to the list
    The ability to edit a to-do item that's already within the list
    The ability to mark a to-do item as complete
    The ability to reorder the to-do items within the list
    Test covering most integration scenarios
    Utilize Material UI for UI components

## What I would add

    Update styles/alignment to create more uniform look based on todo length and spacing
    Add "drag and drop" feature to reoder (its basic number priority currently)
    Streamline tests more by creating one "setup" function
    Limit Edit function to only one item at a time (currently all items "open up" for editing)
    Fix alignment of todo items/buttons (longer todos don't match up well)
